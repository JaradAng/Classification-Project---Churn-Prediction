    "# Predicting Customer Churn - Classification Project\n",
    "Project Goal\n",
    "- The goal of this project is to use statistical analysis and models on the Telco database in order to accurately predict customer churn and identify the keys drivers. We can measure the success of the model's predicitions by asssessing the accuracy of the model and to monitor future churn to evaluate if overall churn decreases or increases after implenting the recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Description\n",
    "- The telecommunication business is extremely competitive and keeping a customer is cheaper than acquiring a new one. One way to secure revenue is to try to maximize the amount of current customers staying with the company and to understand the factors of churn in order to minimize customers leaving. To acheive this, we will look at our customer database to try an pinpoint the cause of churn and identify ways to lower the company's overall churn ratio.  Previous work shown that higher monthly charges and shorter tenure tends to churn more than longer term contracts. In order to analyze monthly costs, I will be looking into our bundled services with phone and internet as well as churn rates for overall monthly charges.\n",

    "Questions:\n",
    " 1: Do the customers who churn pay on average the same amount as those who do not churn?\n",
    " -           Null Hypothesis: Customers who churn pay on average less than or equal amount to non-churning customers \n",
    " -            Alt Hypothesis: Customers who churn pay more than customer who do not churn   \n",
    "\n",
    " 2: Are customers with fiber optic more or less likely to churn?\n",
    " -          Null Hypothesis: Fiber Optic customers churn less than or equal amount to non-fiber optic customers \n",
    " -           Alt Hypothesis: Fiber Optic customers pay more than non-fiber optic customers      \n",
    "\n",
    " 3: Are month to month customers more or less likely to churn?\n",
    "-            Null Hypothesis: Month to month customers churn less than or equal amount to contracted customers \n",
    "-            Alt Hypothesis: Month to month customers churn more than contracted customers      \n",
    "   \n",
    "4: Does bundling of internet and telephone services mean customers are less likely to churn than just internet or just phone customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "-            Null Hypothesis - Customers who bundled are equal or more likely to churn.\n",
    "-            Alt Hypothesis - Customer who bundled internet and phone are less likely to churn.\n",

    " ## Summary \n",
    "    1. Telco has a churn of 27%. The baseline to test against my models will be 73% which would be the accuracy if I did we guessed that a customer would not churn for all customers.  My model out preformed with an accuracy of 80.24% out preformed the baseline prediction. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. New Telco customers are more likely to churn than customers who have been with the company awhile. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Monthly charges have a positive correlation to churn rate. As the monthly charge increases so does the likelyhood of churn.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. The top factors for churn include high monthly charges, month-to-month Contract, customers who bundle phone and internet, and customers with fiber optic internet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "-    I recommend the company to incentivize month to month customers to switch to a contract through some form of a discount.\n",
    "-  Have the company look at incentivizing fiber optic internet service  without bundling a phoneline.Currently all customers with fiber bundle their plan with a phoneline. Incentivizing a non-bundled would help lower the churn rate to that of non-bundled customers, which is less than half of overall churn rate. \n",
    "-  Additionally, customer with security features and tech support stay longer than customers without. Offering a bundle deal with those features will help reduce churn\n",
    "-  The company can look into updating their streaming service and offerings becuase customers churn less without streaming service, especially in fiber.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "-  If possible, I would ask for pricing detail for every featue and service to breakdown why monthly charges trend higher with tenure.\n",
    "-  Ask if any promotions were in place for customers for signing up for all contract types.\n",
    "-  Implement more sophisticated models and hyperparametes to acheive a higher accuracy. \n"
